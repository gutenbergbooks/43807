<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>GOING NUTTING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bessie</span> was the only child of a poor
widow. The mother and daughter lived
alone together in a small house, about half
a mile from Nelly's home.</p>

<p>Bessie's father died when she was quite
young, so young that she did not remember
him. There was a portrait of him,
which her mother kept in her top bureau
drawer in her own room. Occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the little girl was allowed to look at it.
It made her feel very sad to do so, and the
tears rose in her eyes whenever she
thought of what her mother must have
suffered in so great a loss. In the hard
task which fell to that mother of supporting
herself and her child, she did not murmur.
Before her husband's death, she had
lived in very comfortable circumstances,
but this did not unfit her to work for her
living afterwards.</p>

<p>She gathered and sent fruit to market
from her little place, she made butter and
sold it to whomever cared to buy, she knit
stockings for her neighbors' children, and,
every winter, quilted to order at least one
dozen patchwork counterpanes, with wonderful
yellow calico suns in their centre.
By these means she contrived to keep out
of debt, and amass a little sum besides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
At the commencement of our story, however,
a severe fit of illness had so wasted
her strength and devoured her little means,
that the poor widow felt very much discouraged.
The approach of winter filled
her with dread, for she knew that it would
be to her a time of great suffering.</p>

<p>Still, feeble as she was, she managed to
continue, but very irregularly, Bessie's
reading and writing lessons. Bessie was
not a promising scholar; she liked to do
any thing in the world but study. She
would look longingly out of the window a
dozen times in the course of a single lesson,
and when her mother reproved her
by rapping her rather smartly on the head
with her thimble, Bessie would only laugh,
and say she guessed her skull must be
thick, for the lesson <i>would not</i> get through,
and the thimble did not hurt a bit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessie, and Nellie Brooks, of whom my
readers have heard in the former stories
of this series, were very much attached to
each other. Bessie was younger than Nellie,
but that did not stand in the way of
their affection. Nellie, imperfect as she
was herself, used to try sometimes to teach
Bessie how to improve her wild ways. Bessie
would listen and listen, as grave as a
cat watching a rat hole, but her little eyes
would twinkle in the midst of the reproof,
and she would burst into a merry shout,
and say, "I do declare, Nell, it isn't any
use at all to talk to me about being any
better. I'm like the little birds; they're
born to fly and sing, and I'm born to be
horrid and naughty, and dance, and cry,
and laugh, just when I shouldn't,&mdash;there!
I can't be good, anyway. Sometimes I try,
and mother looks as pleased as can be, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
all at once, before I know it, I flounder
straight into mischief again."</p>

<p>One beautiful autumn day, Nellie and
Bessie went nutting in the woods. Each
of the little girls had a basket on her arm,
and Bessie had a bag besides; for they had
great hopes of coming home heavily loaded.
It was early in October. The leaves
of the trees had begun to fall, but those
that remained were bright with many
colors, the crimson of the maple trees particularly,
making the whole woods look gay.
A soft, golden mist, such as we only see at
this season of the year, hung over every
thing, and veiled even the glitter of a little
river which flowed past the village and
coursed onward to the ocean.</p>

<p>At first the children met with very little
success. The first few nut-trees they encountered
had evidently been visited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
some one before. The marks of trampling
feet were visible on the damp ground beneath,
and the branches had been stripped
in such rude haste as to take away both
the leaves and the fruit.</p>

<p>"We'll meet better luck further back in
the woods," said Nell; "this is too near
home. The village people can come here
too easily for us to expect to find any
thing."</p>

<p>They walked further on in very good
spirits, climbing over rocks when they
came to them, and swinging their empty
baskets in time to snatches of songs which
they sang together. They had gone in
this way about a mile, when suddenly Bessie
stopped, and fixed her eyes searchingly
on something near them in the grass.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Nellie.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" said Bessie, softly, "don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
speak for a minute till I see! It's an animal!"</p>

<p>"A bear?" exclaimed Nellie, in some
alarm, quite unmindful of Bessie's request
for silence, for Nelly was a little bit of a
coward, and had a firm belief in all woods
being full of wild animals. As she spoke,
the noise seemed to startle whatever the
creature was that Bessie was watching, for
it ran quickly among the dried leaves that
strewed the grass, and bounded on a high
rock not far distant.</p>

<p>"There!" said Bessie, in a vexed tone,
"you've frightened him away. We might
have tracked him to his hole if you had
kept still."</p>

<p>"I was afraid it was a bear," said Nelly,
half ashamed.</p>

<p>"A bear!" cried Bessie, in great scorn;
"I'd like to see a bear in <i>these</i> woods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you? <i>I</i> wouldn't," said Nelly.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;well&mdash;I mean there isn't a
bear around here for hundreds of miles.
That was a squirrel you frightened away.
Didn't he look funny springing up there?"</p>

<p>"He's there now, looking at us. Don't
you see his head sticking out of that bush?
What bright eyes he has."</p>

<p>Bessie found that it was so. There was
the squirrel's head, twisted oddly on one
side, in order to get a good view of his disturbers.
His keen eyes were fixed anxiously
on them, as though to discover the
cause of their intrusion. Presently he
leaped on a branch of a shrub, and sat
staring solemnly at them.</p>

<p>"It can't be a squirrel," said Bessie,
"after all; its tail is not half bushy or long
enough."</p>

<p>"It jumps like one," said Nellie, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
its eyes and ears are just like a squirrel's
too. See, it's gray and white!"</p>

<p>They approached slowly, the little animal
permitting them to come quite close,
and then the children saw that it was indeed
a squirrel, but that its tail had, by
some accident, been torn nearly half away.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it has been caught in a trap,"
suggested Nelly.</p>

<p>"Or in a branch of a tree," said Bessie.
"Well, anyway, little Mr. Squirrel, we shall
know you again if we meet you."</p>

<p>"I should say," exclaimed Nelly, "that
there must be plenty of nuts somewhere
near us, or that gray squirrel would not be
likely to be here."</p>

<p>The two girls now set about searching
for a hickory nut-tree, quite encouraged in
the thought that their walk was to be rewarded
at last. Nelly was right in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
conjecture. It was not long before they
recognized the well-known leaf of the species
of tree of which they were in quest.
A small group of them stood together, not
far distant, and great was the delight of the
children to find the ground beneath well
strewed with nuts, some of them lying
quite free from their rough outer shells,
others only partially opened, while many
of them were still in the exact state in
which they hung upon the tree. Of course
the former were preferred by the little nut
gatherers, but it was found that as these
did not fill the bag and baskets, it was
necessary to shell some of the remainder.
Accordingly, Bessie selected a large flat
stone, as the scene of operation, and providing
herself with another small one, as a
hammer, she began pounding the unshelled
nuts, and by these means accumulated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
second store; Nelly gathering them, and
making a pile beside her, ready to be denuded
of their hard green coverings.</p>

<p>"There," triumphantly said Nelly, after
a little while; "that dear little squirrel told
the truth. Here is quite a pile of shells
showing the mark of his teeth. See, Bessie,
he has nibbled away the sides of all
these, and eaten the meat. How neatly it
is done, and what sharp little fangs he
must have!"</p>

<p>The bag and baskets were soon filled,
and the two children turned homeward.
The day was a warm one for that season
of the year, and their burdens were very
hard to carry on that account. Many a
time they paused on the path to put down
the baskets and rest.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Nelly, "that when we get
out to the open road, some wagon will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
come along that will give us a lift. Who
would have thought that nuts could be so
heavy? I am so warm and <i>so</i> thirsty, I do
not know how to get along, and there isn't
a single brook about here that we can
drink out of."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how we will fix it," said
Bessie. "I remember, last year, when I
came nutting, I saw a little house, a poor
little concern,&mdash;not half as nice as ours,
and dear knows that is poor enough,&mdash;standing
in the edge of the wood, about
half a mile below where we are now. We
can stop when we get there, and I will
go in and borrow a tin cup to drink out of
the well."</p>

<p>"A half mile!" echoed Nelly, in a tone
of weariness; "I don't believe we shall get
there in an hour, I am so very, very tired."</p>

<p>They walked on slowly, the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
heaviness of the warm October day making
each of them feel that to go nutting
in such weather was very hard work. At
last the little house presented itself. It
was a poor place indeed. It was built of
rough pine boards that had never been
painted. A dog lay sleeping before the
door, the upper half of which was open,
and through which the sunshine poured
into the room. The house stood, as Bessie
had said, on the edge of the wood, large,
fertile fields extending in the distance, on
the opposite side from that by which the
children had approached it.</p>

<p>"You knock," said Bessie, getting struck
with a fit of shyness, as the two walked up
the path to the door.</p>

<p>"No, <i>you</i>," said Nelly, "I don't know
what to say."</p>

<p>The dog got up, stretched himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
gave vent to a low growl, as he surveyed
the new comers.</p>

<p>"Good fellow, nice fellow," said Bessie,
coaxingly, putting out her hand towards
him as she did so; but the good, nice fellow's
growl deepened into a loud, savage
bay. The children stood still, irresolute
whether to retreat or not. Attracted by
the noise, a pale, sickly girl about fifteen
years of age, came to the door, and leaning
over the lower half which was shut, seemed
by looking at them to ask what they
wanted.</p>

<p>"Please," said Bessie, "would you mind
lending me a tin dipper to drink out of at
your well?"</p>

<p>"Haven't got any well," said the girl;
"but you can drink out of the spring if
you've a mind to. There it is, down by
that log: it runs right from under it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
You'll find a mug lying 'long side. Do
stop your noise, Tiger."</p>

<p>The children set down their baskets, and
moved towards the spring very gladly.
They found the mug, and each enjoyed a
drink of the pure, cold water. While doing
so, they observed that near the little
barn at the rear of the house, a man was
harnessing a sleek, comfortable looking
horse to a market wagon, laden with cabbages
and potatoes. The man was thin
and white looking, and it seemed to the
children as if the proper place for him
were his bed. He did not see the visitors,
but went on with his work. The girls
having finished drinking, returned to the
front door, over which still leaned the
sickly girl.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you," said Nelly, "it's
a beautiful spring; clear and cold as ever
I saw."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tisn't healthy though," said the girl;
"leastways, we think it's that that brings
us all down with the fever every spring
and fall."</p>

<p>"The fever!" echoed Bessie, "what fever?"</p>

<p>"The fever'n nager," replied the girl.
"Mother is in bed with it now, and though
father is getting ready to go to town to
market, the shakin' is on him right powerful.
I'm the only one that keeps about,
and that is much as ever, too."</p>

<p>"What makes you drink it?" asked Bessie.
"I wouldn't, if it made me so sick."</p>

<p>"Have to," said the girl, "there is no
other water hereabouts."</p>

<p>"Can't your father <i>move?</i>" said Nelly.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he <i>like</i> to, if he could?" continued
Nelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess not," said the girl, "we mean
to get used to it. We can't afford to move.
Father owns the place, and he has no
chance to sell it. The farm is good, too.
We raise the best cabbages and potatoes
around here. Guess you've been nutting,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, with some pride, "we
have those two baskets and this bag <i>full</i>."</p>

<p>"Is it much fun?" asked the girl pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Splendid," said Bessie; "don't you ever
try it?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm always too sick in nut season&mdash;have
the shakes. But I do believe
I should like to some time. Are you two
little girls going soon again?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Bessie, "may be so.
If we do, shan't we stop and see if you are
able to go along? Your house isn't much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
out of the way; we can stop just as well
as not."</p>

<p>The pale girl looked quite gratified at
these words of Bessie, but said that she
didn't know whether the "shakes" would
allow her.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bessie, "we will stop for
you, anyway. My mother would say, I
am sure, that the walk would do you good.
Good-by. I hope you will all get better
soon."</p>

<p>"Stop a moment," said the girl, "don't
you live somewhere down by the Brooks'
farm?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nelly, "that is my home,
and Bessie lives only a little way beyond."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the girl, smiling, "I
think I've seen you when I have been riding
by with father. He's going that way,
now: wouldn't you like to get in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
wagon with him? He will pass your
house."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess his load is heavy enough
already," said Nelly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the girl; "you just
wait here, while I go ask him."</p>

<p>She darted off before they could detain
her, and in a short time more, the horse
and wagon appeared round the corner of
the house, the man driving the fat horse
(which, as far as the children could see,
was the only fat living creature on the
place), and the girl walking at the wagon
side.</p>

<p>"There they are," the children heard
her say, as she neared them.</p>

<p>The man smiled good naturedly, and
bade Bessie and Nelly jump in. He arranged
a comfortable seat for them on
the board on which he himself sat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"But isn't your load very heavy already,
sir?" asked Nelly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said the farmer; "my
horse will find it only a trifle, compared to
what we usually take. It isn't full market
day to-morrow is the reason. Jump in!
jump in!"</p>

<p>The children needed no other bidding,
but clambered up by the spokes of the
great wheels and seated themselves, one
on each side of the farmer, who took their
nuts, and placed them safely back among
his vegetables.</p>

<p>Then he cracked his whip, and called
out, "Good-by, Dolly. I'll be home about
eleven o'clock to-night. Take good care
of your mother."</p>

<p>The next moment the little girls were
in the road, going homeward as fast as the
sleek horse could carry them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE RIDE HOME.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">So</span> you've been nutting, eh?" said Mr.
Dart (for that was the farmer's name),
looking first on one side of him and then
on the other, where his two companions
sat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Nelly, "and we have had
real good luck too. Only see how full our
baskets are."</p>

<p>"Dolly told me you were going to stop
for her some time, to go nutting with
you," said the farmer, turning round as he
spoke, and putting a cabbage that was jolting
out of the wagon back into its place.
"I am glad of that: I hope she will be
able to accompany you. If you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
chance to come on one of her well days, I
guess she will."</p>

<p>"Well days, sir?" asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"Yes; she has the fever'n nager pretty
bad, and that brings her a sick day and a
well day, by turns. It's the natur' of the
disease."</p>

<p>"What! sick <i>every</i> other day!" cried
Bessie;&mdash;"well, if that is not too bad!
And she seems so good too. Why, we
owe this ride to her."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the farmer, "Dolly is a pretty
good little girl. Never had much trouble
with Dolly in all her life. She's always
willin' to help round the house as much as
she can, and now that her mother is down
with the nager, I couldn't get along without
her, anyway. In the summer time
Dolly makes garden with the best of us.
Many is the field she's sowed with grain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
after I've ploughed it up. Half of these
ere cabbages Dolly cut and put in the
wagon herself. You see that little basket
back in the corner?"</p>

<p>The children looked back in the wagon,
and there, sure enough, was a small covered
basket, jolting around among the potatoes.</p>

<p>"That's Dolly's water cresses," said Mr.
Dart. "I haven't taken a load to market
for the last month without Dolly's basket
of watercresses. She gathers them herself,
down in our meadow, where the ground
is wet and soft, and where they thrive like
every thing. They seem to be getting poor
now, and I don't believe Doll will be able
to pick many more this year. Why, the
money that girl has made off them cresses
is wonderful. I always hand it right over
to her, and she puts it by to save against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a time of need. Cresses sell just like wildfire
in our market-place,&mdash;I mean, of
course, fine ones like my Dolly's are in
their prime."</p>

<p>"Cresses," said Bessie, with growing interest,
"do people really pay money for
<i>cresses?</i> Why, the field back of our house
is full of 'em! They have great, thick,
green leaves, and they look as healthy as
possible."</p>

<p>"Do they?" said the farmer, smiling at
her kindly; "well, then I can just tell
you your folks are fortunate. They
ought to sell 'em and make money out
of them."</p>

<p>"I wish we could," said Bessie, clasping
her hands at the thought, "how glad
mother would be if we could! Mother is
sick, sir, and cannot do all the work she
used, to earn money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said the former, with a look of
concern; "I am sorry to hear that,
my little girl. I know what it is to be
sick, and have sick folks about me.
What's the matter? has she got the nager
too?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bessie, "we don't have
that down our way. I don't know what
<i>does</i> ail mother. She sort o' wastes away
and grows thin and pale."</p>

<p>"Like enough it's the nager," said the
farmer; "there is nothing like it for making
a body thin and pale."</p>

<p>"That's Bessie's house," cried Nelly, as
a sudden turn in the road revealed their
two homes, at the foot of the hill, "that
white one with the smoke curling out of
the left hand chimney."</p>

<p>"And a nice little place it is too," said
the farmer. "I pass right by it almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
every day, and sometimes in the middle of
the night, when all little girls are in their
beds and asleep."</p>

<p>Bessie looked at the kind-hearted farmer,
and wondered to herself what could
bring him so near her home in the nighttime.
As her thoughts by this time were
pretty well filled with what he called the
"nager," she concluded that it must be for
the purpose of getting the doctor for himself
and his family. The farmer, however,
who seemed fond of talking, soon undeceived
her.</p>

<p>"You see," he began, "that it is a very
long drive from my house to town, say
eight miles, at the least, and when I start
as I have to-day, about sundown, it takes
me, with a heavy load, generally, till half
past eight o'clock to get to the market.
Well, then I unload, and sell out to a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
customer I have, a man who keeps a
stand of all sorts of vegetables, and who
generally buys them over night in this
way. Then I turn round and come back.
It is often eleven o'clock when I reach
home and go to bed. Sometimes, again,
according to the orders I have from town,
Dobbin and I start&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dobbin?" interrupted Bessie, "is Dobbin
the horse, sir?"</p>

<p>The farmer nodded smilingly, and continued,
"Dobbin and I start at five o'clock
in the morning, and we go rattling into
market, just in time to have the things
hurriedly sorted and in their places, before
the buyers begin to throng about the stalls.
I stop there a while, but I get home before
noon, and Dolly always has my dinner
ready to rest me, while Dobbin eats his to
rest <i>him</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish Dolly could go to our school,"
said Nelly, after a pause. "Miss Milly, our
teacher, is so good to us all. She lives in
this little house that we are passing."</p>

<p>The farmer looked round at the school-house,
and Nelly thought she heard him
sigh as he did so. "Dolly is a smart girl,
and a nice girl," said he, gravely, "but I
am afraid her mother and I can't give her
much book larnin'. Wish I could: but
times are hard and money scarce. Dolly
knows how to read and write, and I guess
she will have to be content. Her health
isn't strong, either, and she couldn't stand
study."</p>

<p>"Here we are, sir, this is our house,"
cried Nelly, as the wagon neared the farm-house
gate. "I'm very much obliged to
you for my lift."</p>

<p>The farmer handed down her basket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
nuts, and told her she was quite welcome.
Bessie called out good-by, and the farmer
drove on again. A short distance brought
them to Bessie's house. As she in her turn
was getting down, Mr. Dart asked her if
she had any objections to show him the
water-cress field of which she had spoken.
Bessie was delighted to do it, so Dobbin
was tied to a tree, and the little girl led
the way to the back of the house.</p>

<p>"Does the field belong to your mother?"
asked the farmer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Bessie, "this house and
the garden and the wet meadow where
the watercresses grow, mother owns them
all. She's sick now, as I told you, sir, and
oftentimes she lies in her bed and cries to
think we can't get on better in the world.
I'd help her, if I could, but I don't know
any thing to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the wet
meadow, as Bessie called it. It lay only
a stone's throw back of the house. It was
called "wet," because a beautiful brook
coursed through it, and moistened the
ground so much as to render it unprofitable
for cultivation. The watercresses
had it all their own way. They grew wild
over nearly the whole field, and extended
down to the very edge of the brook, and
leaned their beautiful bright leaves and
graceful stems into the little stream, as it
flowed over the pebbles.</p>

<p>Bessie led the farmer to a large, flat
stone, where they could stand with dry
feet and survey the scene. The sun
was just setting; they could see the glow
in the west through the grove of trees
that skirted the outer edge of the field;
the birds were just chirping their mournful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
October songs, as they flew about, seeking
for a shelter for the coming night;
the murmur of the brook added not a
little to the serenity of the hour.</p>

<p>The farmer stooped, and reaching his
hand among the wet earth where the
cresses grew, plucked one, and tasted it.</p>

<p>"It is as fine as any I ever ate," said
he, "and, as far as I see, your mother's
meadow is full of just such ones. The
frost and the cold winds have spoiled
ours, but yours are protected by that
hill back there, and are first-rate."</p>

<p>"Do you think we could get money for
them?" cried Bessie, jumping up and
down on the loose stone on which they
stood, until it shook so as almost to make
her lose her balance and fall into the
water; "do you think people will <i>buy</i>
them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," said the farmer, giving his
lips a final smack over the remnant of the
cress, "certainly I do, and they are so
clear from weeds it will be no trouble to
gather them. What is your name, little
girl?"</p>

<p>"Bessie, sir, and my mother's name is
that too. Wouldn't you like to come in
and see her for a moment, to tell her about
the cresses?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day," said the farmer, shaking
his head, and looking at the sinking sun;
"it grows late, and I have a long journey
to go, but I'll tell you what I <i>will</i> do. I
go to market again the day after to-morrow,
and I leave home at five o'clock in
the morning, or thereabouts. Now, I'm
sorry to hear of your mother's troubles,
and I want to help her if I can. You tell
her all I have said about the cresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bringing a good price, and see if she has
any objections to your gathering a big
basket full, and having it ready to send
to market when I pass by. I can take
one for you just as well as not, three or
four times a week. Leave it just inside
the gate, and I will get it, for it will
be too early for you to be up."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Bessie, her face perfectly
radiant with smiles; "how good you are
to take so much trouble&mdash;how good you
are! I'll tell mother all about you, be sure
of that."</p>

<p>"And now I must be off," said the
farmer, stepping from the flat stone into
the moist grass and picking his way as
well as he could towards the house, and
thence to the gate. Bessie followed him
to the road, and watched him untie old
Dobbin. The tears came in her eyes as
she called out,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by, sir, good-by."</p>

<p>The farmer turned, half smiled to see
how grateful the poor child looked, and
said kindly,</p>

<p>"Good-by, Bessie."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>WATER-CRESSES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bessie's</span> mother was both surprised and
rejoiced to hear of the kindness of the
farmer. It seemed to her a great stroke
of good fortune. The little sum of money
which she had saved in more prosperous
days was almost exhausted, and it had been
a bitter thought to her to know, that when
this should be gone, they would have
nothing. The little house in which they
lived could be sold, it is true, but the
widow had always looked upon it in the
light of a <i>home</i>, and not as an article to be
disposed of for support.</p>

<p>A ready consent was given that Bessie
should try what she could do with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
water-cresses. The little girl was delighted
at the prospect, and already she saw herself
the future possessor of a great deal
of money.</p>

<p>Her mother wanted her to gather the
cresses the night previous to the morning
on which the farmer was expected, but in
her enthusiasm, Bessie insisted that they
would be far fresher and nicer when they
reached market if she should do so at daybreak;
and she promised faithfully to rise
in sufficient time to accomplish the feat.</p>

<p>"But, my child," said her mother, "it
will not be light enough for you to choose
the best cresses, and the farmer may come
before you get through, and of course we
could not ask him to wait. No, gather
them late in the afternoon, carefully select
the poor ones, and the dead leaves and
grasses that may be mingled with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and the rest put in the oak pail and cover
them with clean water. In the morning
you can rise as early as you please, and
fasten them up securely in the large basket,
and be ready to give them to the
farmer yourself, if you would like to do so
when he passes."</p>

<p>Bessie acknowledged that this was wisest.
Accordingly, towards the latter part of the
day before the appointed morning, she
provided herself with a basket and the
garden scissors, to go down to the brook
and begin her undertaking. Previous to
doing so, however, she put her head in
her mother's room and called out with a
gay laugh, "good-by, mother, I am going
to make a fortune for you yet, see if I
don't!"</p>

<p>Her mother smiled, and when Bessie
shut the door and jumped lightly down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the stairs, two at a time, she felt as though
her child's courage and hopefulness were
really infusing courage and hopefulness
into herself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="328" height="462" alt="girl with basket" />
<div class="caption">"She was clipping at the cresses, when she heard some one call her name."&mdash;<a href="#Page_45">p.
45.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Singing at the top of her lungs, Bessie
set to work. Never had she felt as light-hearted
and happy. She tucked up her
calico dress a little way, into the strings
of her apron, in order to keep it out of the
wet, and drew off her shoes and stockings.
Then arming herself with the scissors, she
cut vigorously among the cresses; taking
care, however, to choose only those that
presented a fine appearance, for she was
determined that the first specimens the
farmer took with him, should be so fine as
to attract the attention of the buyers, and
thus induce them to come again. A
shrewd little business woman was Bessie!
She had her basket sitting on some stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
near her, and when she moved further up
and down the brook, she was careful always
to move that also. She was singing
away as loudly and heartily as she could,
and clipping at the cresses, when she heard
some one call her name. She looked up,
and there stood a boy about fourteen years
old, named Martin, who lived on Nelly's
father's farm. He looked as though he
wanted very much to laugh at the odd
figure which Bessie cut; her sun-bonnet
hanging by its strings to her neck, her
dress tucked up to the knees, a pair of
shears in one hand, an enormous basket in
the other, and both of her bare feet in the
brook.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie," said Martin, "what a
noise you have been making! I called
you four or five times <i>real loud</i>, and I
whistled too, and yet you went on singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
'Old folks at home,' and 'Little drops of
water,' as though your ears were not made
to hear any voice but your own!"</p>

<p>"That's 'cause I'm <i>so</i> happy," said Bessie.
"Why, Martin, I'm beginning to earn
my own living,&mdash;think of <i>that</i>. Isn't it
fun though?" and she splashed through
the stream to have a nearer talk with her
visitor.</p>

<p>"Earning your living!" repeated Martin;
"well, I should call playing in the
brook, as you seemed to be just now, any
thing but that."</p>

<p>"Playing!" echoed Bessie, with some
indignation, "I am a big girl of nine now,
and I am not going to play any more; I
am going to <i>work</i>. Don't you see these
cresses?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Martin, "but they're not
good for much, are they?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" laughed Bessie, capering
about, quite unmindful of bare ankles,
"Good! I shouldn't wonder <i>much</i> if they
were. Why, Martin Wray, I'm to sell
'em, and get <i>money</i> for 'em&mdash;plenty of
it&mdash;till my pockets are so full that they
cannot hold any more&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"Money!" said Martin, "you don't
mean to say people buy cresses? What
can they do with them?"</p>

<p>"Eat 'em," replied Bessie, promptly;
"mother says rich folks buy them to
make into salads,&mdash;mustard, pepper, salt,
vinegar, and all that sort of thing, you
know. Mother says they are just in
their prime now."</p>

<p>Martin stooped and helped himself to
a handful of the cresses. He did not
seem to like their flavor, but made wry
faces over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear, dear," he said, "how they bite!
They will take my tongue off."</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of 'em," said Bessie,
coolly, "that's a proof that they are
good. Mother says when they grow flat
and insipid they don't bring a fair price."</p>

<p>"But isn't this late in the year for
them?" asked her visitor.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer; "this is just
the best of the fall crop, and they will
last for a month or six weeks, and maybe
all winter, if the season is mild. May is
the great spring month for them, and
October the one in the autumn. Mother
told me she brushed the snow away from
a little patch last Christmas, and there
they were just as fresh and green as ever."</p>

<p>"And who are you going to sell them
to?" asked Martin.</p>

<p>"A farmer," answered Bessie, "who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
lives up in the nutting woods has promised
to take them to market."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Martin, "that reminds me
of what I came for. Nelly knew I had
to pass by here to-day with a letter, and
she asked me to inquire if you would
go nutting with her and me to-morrow.
She wants to stop for another little girl
too, I believe."</p>

<p>"Dolly?" said Bessie.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Martin, "what
her name was. She said it was a girl
who had the fever and ague."</p>

<p>"That's Dolly!" cried Bessie, joyfully,
"Dolly has it <i>awful</i>. Just wait here a
minute while I run ask mother if she
can spare me."</p>

<p>She went skipping in the house, and
in a short time her bare feet were heard
skipping out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, triumphantly waving
her sun-bonnet, "mother told me 'yes.'"</p>

<p>Martin now said he must go on and
deliver his letter, and Bessie bade him
good-by, and went back to her cresses.
In a little while the basket was filled
with the very finest the brook afforded,
and she carried them in the house to
place in water as her mother had directed.</p>

<p>The next morning, as the gray dawn
came through the window of the room
where she and her mother slept, Bessie
awoke suddenly, and before she knew it
she was sitting up in bed, drowsily rubbing
her eyes. She had borne so well
on her mind the appointment with the
farmer, that she had awakened long before
her usual time. She was a lazy
girl generally, and liked very much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lie luxuriously in bed and <i>think about</i>
getting up, without making an effort to
do so. It was at least three hours earlier
than it was her habit to rise, yet
she did not stop to think of that, but
bounded out and began her morning's
ablution; her mother having always
striven to impress upon her the great
fact that "cleanliness is next to godliness."
It was but a short time when, leaving
her mother, as she thought, soundly
sleeping, Bessie crept noiselessly as possible
down the stairs that led to the
kitchen, and there carefully packed her
cresses for market. When the basket
was full, she wrapped hastily a shawl
around her, to protect her from the
chilly autumn air of the morning, and
ran out to the gate to place it, ready
for the farmer, when he should come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
along in his wagon. She stood on the
cross bars of the gate, and looked eagerly
up and down the road, but she
saw nothing as yet. The thought crossed
her mind that Mr. Dart might already
have passed the house, and finding no
basket prepared for him, had driven on
without it. But when she looked around,
and saw how early it still appeared, how
the gray was not gone from the sky,
and the sun had not risen, nor the soft
white morning mists yet rolled away
from the mountains that lay to the left
of the village, she was quite sure that
she was not too late. She went back
to the open door sill of the kitchen,
which, being built in a small wing,
fronted on the road, and sat down quietly
on the sill. Presently she thought
she heard the rattle of wheels, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
snapping of a whip. She ran to the
gate, and looked in the direction from
which it was to be expected the farmer
would come, and there he was, seated
on top of a load of turnips, trotting
down the road as fast as old Dobbin
could go, under the circumstances. He
saw Bessie, and shook his whip over
his head as a sort of salutation.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Bessie, as soon
as he was near enough to hear her
voice.</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied the farmer,
holding Dobbin up, so as to stop. "Well
now, this looks something like! I guess
you're most as smart as my Dolly, who
got up and fixed breakfast before I
started. What does mother say about
the water-cresses, eh?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," cried Bessie, joyfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
lugging into view the basket, "and here
they are, sir, all ready,&mdash;beauties, <i>every
one</i> of 'em."</p>

<p>The farmer raised the cover, looked
in, and whistled.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "this is the pick of
the whole lot, I guess. But you haven't
half big enough a basket. You must
send more next time, for the frost may
come and nip them a little, before you
sell enough to be worth your while.
Haven't you ever heard of making hay
while the sun shines, Bessie?"</p>

<p>He took the basket and packed it
nicely among the turnips, so that it
would not jostle out with the movement
of the wagon. As he did so, Bessie's
mother, with a shawl hastily thrown
around her, opened the window of her
bedroom, and said sufficiently loud to
be heard,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morning, sir; I am afraid you
are putting yourself to a great deal of
trouble for us."</p>

<p>"Not at all, ma'am," said the farmer,
quite surprised at her sudden apparition,
and taking off his hat as he spoke; "on
the contrary, it's quite a pleasure."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you, I
am sure," said the widow, "and Bessie
is too. It is very kind of you to help
us, poor people as we are, along in the
world."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am," said the farmer with
a smile, "as far as that goes, I'm poor
myself&mdash;poor enough, dear knows, and
that's the very thing that sometimes
makes me feel for other poor folks, particularly
poor <i>sick</i> folks, for we 'most
always have a spell of the nager at our
house. But I must be off. I'll stop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ma'am, as I come back, about noon, to
tell you what luck I have had with
these ere cresses."</p>

<p>He was just going to drive on when
Bessie said, "Oh, sir, I almost forgot.
Is to-day Dolly's <i>well</i> day? Nelly and
I thought of going nutting with her."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the farmer, "Doll is
pretty smart to-day. Make no doubt
she can go. Good morning, ma'am, good
morning, Bessie;" and he touched up
old Dobbin and trotted down the hill.</p>

<p>Bessie stood with the shawl over her
head to watch the wagon as it seemed
to grow less and less in size, and finally
was hid by a curve of the road. Then
she pulled to the gate to keep out stray
cows from the little garden which her
mother prized so much, and reëntered
the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>She had a great many things to
accomplish during the morning, because
now that her mother was sick a number
of household duties devolved upon her,
with which she had nothing to do under
ordinary circumstances. But, keep herself
as busy as she could, the time still
hung heavily. It seemed to her as if
noon would never come. Her mother
tried to hear her say her lessons in the
intervals, when she had to sit up, but
Bessie could not attend enough to repeat
them well. She made many strange
mistakes.</p>

<p>The top of every page in her spelling-book
was decorated with a picture which
illustrated whatever word stood at the
head of the column. Thus, <i>chandelier</i>,
<i>work-box</i>, <i>bedstead</i>, were each represented
in a pretty engraving. I suppose this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was done in order to excite the interest
of the scholar. Bessie's thoughts to-day
were so far away with her water-cresses,
however, that she could think of nothing
else. At the head of her column for the
morning was the word <i>ladle</i>, and at its
side was the picture of a stout servant
girl, ladling out a plate of soup from a
tureen. The shape of the ladle so much
resembled a skimmer which Bessie had
often seen in use in her mother's
kitchen, that with her thoughts following
the farmer in his wagon, she spelled
and pronounced in this wise:</p>

<p>"L-a, skim, d-l-e, mer, <i>skimmer!</i>"</p>

<p>"My patience," said her mother, "what
nonsense is that, Bessie, which you are
saying?"</p>

<p>"L-a, skim, d-l-e, mer, skimmer," gravely
repeated Bessie, quite unconscious of the
droll mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother could not but laugh, but
she asked her if such inattention was
kind to herself when she was so ill as
scarcely to be able to speak, much less
to question over and over again a girl
who did not care whether she learned
or not.</p>

<p>"But I <i>do</i> care, mother," cried Bessie,
coloring.</p>

<p>"Then why do you try me so? Take
your book and study your spelling properly."</p>

<p>Bessie did so, and this time, mastering
her inclination to think of other
things, soon accomplished her task.</p>

<p>"It is not because you are a dull
child," said her mother, "that you do
not learn, but because you are a careless
one. The least thing comes between
you and your lessons. This morning, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
suppose you are somewhat to be excused,
but I cannot express to you how you
weary me, day after day, by the same
conduct."</p>

<p>These words filled Bessie with shame.
She really loved her mother, and there
were few things she would not have
done to please her. She did not realize
how simple thoughtlessness can pain and
annoy those whom we would not purposely
wound.</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Bessie, casting
down her eyes, "I <i>do</i> wish I was good.
Maybe I am not big enough yet, am I,
mother?"</p>

<p>Her mother smiled, saying, "You are
plenty big enough, and plenty old enough
too."</p>

<p>Bessie smiled too, and was happy to
see that her mother was not as vexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
with her as she thought. She went up
to her and gave her a little shy kiss on
her cheek.</p>

<p>"It is <i>such</i> hard work to be good,"
she said, "and it does <i>so</i> bother me to
be thinkin' of it all the time. Wouldn't
it be nice if we could be good without
any trouble? When I am grown up I
hope I'll be good, anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh Bessie," said her mother, seriously,
"do not wait till then. While you are
young is the time to break yourself of
bad habits and slothful ways. If you
wait until you become a woman, they
will have fastened themselves upon you
so that you cannot shake them off."</p>

<p>Just as Bessie's mother pronounced
the last words, she heard a knock on
one of the outer doors. Bessie heard
it too, and ran down stairs to open it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
It was now nearly time to expect Mr.
Dart, and her heart beat with delight
at the anticipation of the news she was
so soon to hear.</p>

<p>She opened the door, and saw, not
the kind face of the farmer, but that
of a small, ungainly boy, who lived in
the next house. He was a sickly, spoiled
child, and Bessie, never liking him much
at the best of times, found him now
rather an unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>"Our folks wants to know if your
mother'll lend us some sugar," he said,
at the same time handing out a cracked
tea-cup.</p>

<p>Bessie took the cup and invited the
boy to go up and see her mother, while
she brought the sugar. She had just
filled the cup even full, when again she
heard a knock. This time she felt sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it was the farmer, and indeed when she
flew to the door, there he stood, smiling
at her in the porch. One of his hands
was extended towards her, and in its
palm she saw three bright silver coins!</p>

<p>"Take them, Bessie," he said, "they
are your own. Them cresses o' your'n
were the best in market. I'm coming
along to-morrow morning at the same
time, and if you like, you can have
another lot for me. Here's your basket,
but it isn't half big enough, as I
told you before."</p>

<p>Bessie stood holding the money in
her hands, quite unable to utter a word.
Her first thought was to dash up stairs
and tell her mother, her next to run
after the farmer and thank him. But
he had already mounted into his seat and
Dobbin, very glad to know that his nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was turned homeward, had taken the
hint to start off at a pace that soon
placed his driver out of hearing.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said Bessie, gazing
after the wagon in much the same way
as she had done in the morning. "Mother
will say I forgot my politeness <i>that</i> time.
And he so kind too!"</p>

<p>She ran in the house again, and in a
moment was in her mother's room.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother," she cried, holding
out the coins, "you can have every
thing you want now! See, here's money,
plenty of it! I don't believe I ever saw
so much at once in all my life. How
many goodies you shall have to make
you well!"</p>

<p>Her mother was lying partially dressed
outside the bed-quilts, but she rose up
slowly to share Bessie's joy. Bessie put
the money in her hands and danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
around the room like a wild girl, utterly
regardless of the fire-tongs that she
whirled out of place, and a couple of
chairs, which she laid very neatly flat
on their sides in the middle of the floor.
Then she flew at her mother and gave
her two monstrous, <i>sounding</i> kisses on
each cheek. Her mother gave them
right straight back to her, and I can
assure you Bessie wasn't at all sorry to
have them returned.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie," said the little boy,
who had been a silent spectator all this
time, "what is the matter with you?
You act real crazy."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> crazy," said Bessie, good-humoredly,
"just as crazy as can be. This
is my water-cress money. Didn't you
know I can earn money for mother?
How much is there, mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow spread out the three coins
in her hand, and after a moment's pause,
said,</p>

<p>"Here are two twenty-five cent pieces,
and a ten cent piece; that makes just
sixty cents."</p>

<p>Bessie sat perfectly still, and when
her mother looked at her, attracted by
an unusual sound, she had her apron
up to her eyes, crying as peacefully as
possible.</p>

<p>"Why, my foolish little girl," said her
mother, "I can't have any tears shed in
this way. Jump up like a good child
and get Nathan his sugar."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," sobbed Bessie, "I
didn't know I was agoin' to till I did."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of doing
with it all?" asked Nathan, eyeing the
money with some curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Save it," answered Bessie, promptly,
"till mother gets ready to use it." She
went to a table standing at the head
of the bed, and from its drawer she took
out a large-sized Madeira nut, that had
been given to her by her uncle the
previous Christmas. The two halves
were joined together by a steel hinge,
and when a small spring was touched
on the opposite side, they opened. Bessie
touched it now, and advancing to
her mother, said,</p>

<p>"Let's keep the money in this nut,
mother, for a purse, until you want to
spend it."</p>

<p>Her mother dropped the silver in the
open shell, and Bessie closed it and
replaced it in the drawer. Then she
and Nathan went down to get the
sugar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>HUNGRY FISHES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about two o'clock when Bessie,
basket in hand, started to go on the
nutting excursion which Nelly and Martin
had planned for that day.</p>

<p>She scarcely liked to be absent long,
for she knew her mother was not quite
as well as usual, and then, too, the
water-cresses were to be gathered and
prepared for the next day's market.
At all events she made up her mind to
get home early, long before the sun
should set.</p>

<p>It was but a short walk of a half
mile to Nelly's home; Martin and Nelly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were ready, so that no time was consumed
in waiting.</p>

<p>It was even a more beautiful day
than the one on which the previous
nutting had taken place. The woods
were brighter colored than ever, and
the golden autumn mist seemed to cover
every thing with beauty. It hung in
wreaths around the tops of the high
trees, and swayed softly back and forth
when the breeze stirred it. The boats
on the river could scarcely be discerned
through it, and the opposite shores were
entirely hidden.</p>

<p>"This is Dolly's <i>well</i> day," said Bessie,
"I asked her father and he told me so."</p>

<p>"Martin says you are going to sell
him some water-cresses," said Nelly; "at
least, I suppose he was the one; did
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie; "that is, he sold
them <i>for</i> me, which is the same thing
you know. He brought me three <i>big</i>
pieces of money for them at noon, and
I put 'em in a nut-shell and shut 'em
up."</p>

<p>"A nut-shell?" repeated Martin, "that
is a funny bank, I think."</p>

<p>"It's a safe one," said Bessie, "and it
will not break and keep the money like
some of those I have heard of in town.
Just look at those bitter-sweets, Nell,
aren't they bright?"</p>

<p>"I mean to get some," cried Nelly, as
she paused to admire the red sprays of
the berries that grew at the side of the
short-cut path they were pursuing. "I
will take them home to mother to put
in her winter bouquets of dried grasses,
that stand on the parlor mantle-shelf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
They will enliven them and make them
much handsomer."</p>

<p>"Why not wait till we return?" said
Martin; "you will have all the trouble
of carrying them to the woods and back
again, and perhaps lose them by the
way."</p>

<p>"I know too much for that," said Nelly,
laughing; "we may not come back by
this road, and then I should not get
them at all. Last week I lost some in
the same way: I went out walking with
Miss Milly over the mountains, and we
came to some beauties near Mulligan's
little shanty. We thought to save ourselves
trouble by leaving them till we
returned. Something or other tempted
us to strike into another path when we
came back, so that our bitter-sweets are
on the top of the mountain yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Bessie, "I don't think they
are. Did they grow over a big rock,
and were there plenty of sumach bushes
between them and the path?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nelly, beginning to pull
down the rich clusters of the bitter-sweets,
and breaking them off, one by
one.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bessie, making a deep,
mock courtesy, "I have the pleasure of
having those berries in my own bedroom
at this blessed minute. I went to
Mulligan's on an errand of mother's, a
few days ago, and I brought them down
the mountain with me."</p>

<p>"Her loss was your gain, wasn't it?"
said Martin, as he aided Nelly to gather
the berries.</p>

<p>"I'll help too," said Bessie, "for I'm
in a <i>dreadful</i> hurry to get back, Nelly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I have all my cresses to pick for market,"
and she too broke off the bunches and
laid them carefully in Nelly's basket.</p>

<p>"What!" said Nelly, "<i>more</i> cresses,
Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, giving a joyful
hop, and, as her mother called it, cutting
a caper; "and that isn't all, for Dolly's
father wants lots and lots <i>and</i> lots more
of 'em! Come, I guess you have plenty
now, let's go on."</p>

<p>Nelly consented to do so, but first
Martin took out of his pocket a handful
of tangled twine, and with a piece of it
tied the bitter-sweet berries together by
the stems, and suspended them in a
bunch from her apron strings, so that
her basket might be ready for the nuts.</p>

<p>Martin was a farm boy who worked
at Nelly's father's place. He was a good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
steady lad, and the two girls liked very
much to have his company in their
excursions. It was not often, however,
that he could be spared, and the present
occasion was, therefore, quite a holiday
in his estimation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">

<div class="caption">"Martin told the girls that if they would place themselves with him on an old
trunk of a tree, they would probably find it to be a better position from which to
throw their lines."&mdash;<a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a></div>
</div>

<p>When the children reached the little
house near the wood, they were surprised
to see Dolly standing in the gateway
quite equipped for the ramble. She
had a large basket on her arm, and a
long hickory stick in her hands. Nelly
introduced Martin, who stood a little
aloof when the girls first met, and then
Dolly asked them if they would not all
come in and rest, but the children
thought that it was best not to do so.
Hearing voices, the farmer came to the
door of the farm house to see them off.
He looked pleased to find Dolly with
the little girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right," he said, "I'm glad to
have my Dolly tramping about like
other folks' children. It will do her
good. But don't stay late: the damp
of the evening is very unwholesome for
the nager."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are coming back long before
night, sir," said Bessie, cheerfully, "'cause
I've got all my cresses to pick for to-morrow.
Mother and I are <i>so</i> much obliged
to you, I can't really <i>tell</i> how much!"</p>

<p>"Quite welcome, quite welcome," said
Mr. Dart; "I'll be on the look-out for
another basket to-morrow then."</p>

<p>As the four children walked briskly
along the path through the woods, Nelly
looked with some curiosity at Dolly's
stick. She could not imagine for what
purpose it was intended. It was not
very stout, nor apparently very heavy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
at the upper end it was a little curved.
Dolly seemed to use it for a staff, and
several times helped herself over some
rough and stony places with it. When
the walking was good she carried it
carelessly over her shoulder, with her
basket swinging at the crooked end.</p>

<p>A short time brought the party to
the place where they had found so many
nuts only a day or two before. Much
to their surprise and mortification the
trees which were lately so loaded, were
now perfectly bare. Some one had
evidently been there during the time
that intervened, and had carried away
the prize. There were several large
piles of the outer shells scattered about
on the ground, but that was all.</p>

<p>"What shall we do," asked Bessie,
mournfully; "I don't think we can find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
another such spot as this was in the
whole woods. This clump of trees was
as full as it could be only the day
before yesterday."</p>

<p>Dolly took her stick and poked among
the branches to see if any remained.
She found about half a dozen, which
she knocked down and put in her basket.</p>

<p>"Now I know," said Nelly, "what
Dolly brought that pole for,&mdash;to knock
down the nuts."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dolly, surveying the stick
in question with some pride, "it is
splendid for that. I call it my cherry-tree
hook, and I use it in cherry time
to pull the branches towards me. But
come, we must push on and seek our
fortunes. Haven't an <i>idee</i> of goin' home
without my basket full."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I give up, for one," said Bessie,
despondently, "I don't think we can
find a thick place again."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bessie," said Martin,
with good-nature, "we'll find a <i>thin</i> one
then. We'll do the best we can, you
may be sure. Come, girls, I'll lead the
way. Let us follow this little footpath
and see where it will take us."</p>

<p>He spoke in an encouraging tone, and
suiting the action to the word, walked
on ahead. The girls followed him in
silence. The underbrush through which
the path led was very thick and high,
and for a short distance nothing could
be discerned on either side. The thorns
caught into the clothing of the little
party, and they found this by no means
an added pleasure. It was not long,
however, before the track broadened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
into a wide, open space, something
similar to the one they had just quitted,
dotted here and there with trees, but,
as fortune would have it, none of them
were nut trees. They were on the point
of penetrating still further towards the
heart of the wood, when a loud rustling
among the dead branches and dried
leaves of the path made the children
turn to discover what was the matter.</p>

<p>A joyful barking followed, and a
rough-looking dog bounded out, and began
prancing about and leaping upon
Dolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only our old Tiger," she
exclaimed; "down, Tige, down, sir!"</p>

<p>But Tiger was so delighted at having
succeeded in finding his young mistress,
that he did not cease indulging in his
various uncouth gambols, until Dolly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stamping her foot and assuming an air
of great severity, bade him <i>be quiet</i>, or
she would send him immediately home.
Tiger seemed to understand the threat,
for he stopped barking and instantly
darted several hundred feet in advance
of the party.</p>

<p>"He does that so that I cannot make
him go back," cried Dolly, laughing at
the sagacity of her favorite; "I never
tell him I will send him home, but that
he runs ahead so as to make it impossible
for me to do as I say."</p>

<p>They continued their wanderings for
some distance further, but with very
poor success.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we can do," said
Martin, with a laugh, as exclamations of
vexation and disappointment were heard
from the girls; "let's turn our nutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
into a fishing excursion. Wouldn't it
be nice if we should each go home with
a string of fish?"</p>

<p>"Fish!" cried Nelly, "what <i>do</i> you
mean, Martin?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of anybody catchin'
fish in the woods!" said Dolly. "There
isn't a drop of water nearer than the
pond the other side of Morrison's hill."</p>

<p>"Well," said Martin, "I know there
is not, but that is not so very far off.
I was just thinking of the shortest way
to get there."</p>

<p>"I know every inch of the country,"
said Dolly, firmly, "and I'm <i>sure</i> Morrison's
pond is at least a good two mile
from here."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can't walk <i>that</i>, Martin,"
cried Bessie; "we should all be tired,
and get home after dark besides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," said Martin, smiling, "I do
not wish to contradict anybody, but I
am acquainted with a path, a rather
rough one to be sure, that will bring us,
in about twenty minutes, to the edge
of the pond. You know it is not as
far away as people think, the crooked,
winding road making it appear a long
way off, when in reality it lies in a
straight line only about half a mile
from the village."</p>

<p>"But if we conclude to go, we can't
<i>fish</i>," said Dolly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" quietly asked Martin.</p>

<p>"We haven't a line or a hook among
us," put forth Nelly, "at least I am sure
<i>I</i> haven't."</p>

<p>"Well <i>I</i> have," replied Martin, "provided
you will not despise bent pins for
hooks, pieces of the twine that is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of that I tied your bitter-sweet berries
with for lines, a hickory stick like Dolly's
for a rod, and earth worms for bait.
There now, haven't I furnished the
whole party with tackle? Come, don't
let us go home without having <i>something</i>
to take with us."</p>

<p>Dolly sat down on the stump of a
tree and began to laugh.</p>

<p>"The idee," she said, "of going nutting
and bringing home <i>fish</i>. Well, I'm
willing, for one, if it's only to find out
the path. I thought I knew all the
ins and outs around here."</p>

<p>"And I'd like to go too," said Nelly.</p>

<p>"I should <i>like</i> to go well enough,"
added Bessie, "if it wasn't that I feel
sure the extra walk will just bring me
home too late for my cresses. Mother
is sick, too, and she cannot be left alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
very long; and Dolly, you know your
father said you must not stay out late."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dolly, "I know he did,
and I don't mean to disobey, but it
can't be very late <i>yet;</i> I should think
not more than half past three."</p>

<p>Martin looked up at the sun and then
down to the shadows on the ground.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "it is not more than
half past three. I am in the habit of
telling time by the sun, and I know
it is not later than that. Come, Bessie,
three to one is the way the case stands.
I guess you will be home time enough."</p>

<p>Bessie stood irresolute. She wished
to go fishing, and she wished to return
home. It was hard to choose. At last
she said,</p>

<p>"It will be four at least when I get
back. I must go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you break up the party,"
said Nelly, in a dissatisfied tone.</p>

<p>"And you spoil the pleasure," added
Dolly, leaning on her stick and looking
at Bessie.</p>

<p>"And you send us all home with
empty baskets when we might each
have a string of fish," continued Martin.
"<i>Do</i> stay!"</p>

<p>The children surrounded Bessie, and
tried to persuade her. At length she
ceased to resist. She endeavored to
assure herself that she was acting right,
but she felt uneasy as she did so, and
the picture of her mother, lying so long
alone in her sick room, rose up to her
mind. Still the temptation was before
her, and she yielded to it. The truth
was, that Bessie had great confidence in
Martin, and when he said that he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
there was plenty of time, she reasoned
with herself that he was a great deal
older than she was, and probably knew
best; so she consented to join the fishing
party. The moment she said "yes,"
Martin exclaimed,</p>

<p>"This way then; follow me, all of
you, and we will soon reach the short-cut
track. It is about here somewhere.
Let us hurry so as to lose no time."</p>

<p>The path was speedily found as he
had said, and the children walked as
rapidly after him as the rough stones
which lay in the way, and the projecting
branches of blackberry bushes would
permit.</p>

<p>When they reached the pond, Martin
took out the pocket knife which he
usually carried about him, and cut down
four slender young trees which he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
growing between the pond and the public
wagon-road at its side. He gave
these to Nelly and asked her if she
would tie the strings securely fast to
the smallest ends, while he and Bessie
overturned stones in search of worms,
and Dolly bent the points of the pins
so as to resemble hooks.</p>

<p>"Why will not my staff do for a
pole?" asked Dolly, as she hammered
at the pins with a large pebble; "you
said it would, Martin."</p>

<p>"That was before I saw these little
trees," replied Martin. "The moment
I came upon them, growing here in a
group among the bushes, I knew they
were just the things I wanted. They
are thin and tapering, and your stick
is not."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
said Dolly; "a pole is only for the
purpose of casting the line out a good
distance into the water, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That is one use for it," said Martin,
"but not all. If a pole is properly
proportioned, that is, if it is the right
size at the handle, and tapers gradually
to the point, the fisherman can feel the
least nibble, and know the exact moment
when to draw up the line. If he could
not feel the movement, the fish might,
in the struggles occasioned by his pain,
carry off bait and hook too."</p>

<p>"In our case that wouldn't be a great
loss," laughed Dolly, and she held up
the pins, neatly bent into shape.</p>

<p>"Martin," said Bessie, in a low voice,
as she stooped to raise a stone at his
side, "I guess I don't care to fish, after
all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Martin saw something was amiss. Instead
of giving utterance to a rude
exclamation, or calling the attention of
the others, he said in a kind tone,</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie, what is the matter now?
Don't you feel right?"</p>

<p>Bessie shook her head. Martin saw
there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I coaxed you," he said.
"I feel now as if I had not behaved as
I ought."</p>

<p>"I never <i>did</i> like to go fishing," said
Bessie; "it <i>hurts</i> me to see the poor little
things pant and flounder when they are
brought up. The moment I heard you
speak of their struggling with the pain,
I was sorrier than ever that I had come,
and that made me think of mother,
staying home alone with <i>her</i> pain. I do
believe I ought to go back at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you cannot find the way," said
Martin; "you have never been here
before."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Bessie, sighing.
"Well, I do not wish to be a spoil-pleasure.
Don't mind me, then, but you
and the others begin your fishing, and
if I see a wagon come by on the road
that is going our way, I can jump in.
I need not stop your sport if I do that."</p>

<p>Martin looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"I hardly like you to try it," he said,
"and yet I do not wish you to stay
against your will."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bessie, "I don't like to
act <i>mean</i>, Martin. Go on fishing for a
little while, at all events. I can wait
half an hour or so, I suppose."</p>

<p>Nelly now called to Martin that the
lines were ready, for Dolly had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
finished tying on the last pin. He
gathered up the bait he had found
beneath the stones, and went towards
the two other girls. He thought, on
consideration, that he might fish for a
short time, while waiting to see if a
wagon approached on the road. If none
did so within the allotted half hour, he
made up his mind to go home. He
blamed himself now for having changed
the destination of the party.</p>

<p>"Here's my line," cried Dolly, holding
it out at the end of her pole, "and now
all that I and the fishes wait for is a
worm."</p>

<p>Martin fastened one on Dolly's pin,
one on Nelly's likewise, and one on the
line he intended for himself.</p>

<p>"Come, Bessie," said Nelly, as she
flung her line into the water, "come
try <i>your</i> luck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bessie does not care about fishing,"
said Martin kindly, "do not press her
if she does not wish it."</p>

<p>The pond was well stocked with a
variety of small fishes, many of which
were considered good eating by the farmers
in the neighborhood. As scarcely any
one ever took the trouble, however, to
go after them, they were hardly acquainted
with hooks or lines, and they
were, consequently, all the more easily
caught. Martin said he had never seen
such hungry fishes before. They snapped
at the bait the moment it was lowered
to them, oftentimes carrying it entirely
off, hook and all.</p>

<p>Once, and the children could scarcely
believe it when they saw it, a fish called
a bull-head leaped at least an inch above
the water and tried to swallow the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of Dolly's line, which she was in the
act of raising, to replace the pin and
worm which some of his greedy kindred
had just taken away.</p>

<p>Martin told the girls that if they
would place themselves with him on
an old trunk of a tree that apparently
had fallen years before into the edge of
the pond, they would probably find it
to be a better position from which to
throw their lines than the shore on
which they had stood at first. "For,"
said he, "the larger fish do not like to
venture into such shallow water." The
trunk, however, was covered with moist
moss, which made it very slippery, and
Nelly came so near losing her balance
and falling in, as she walked up it, that
she concluded to remain where she was.
Martin and Dolly did not meet with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
same difficulty, however, and very soon
they discovered that the nibbles were
far more frequent than before. Martin
kept a twig on which he slipped the
fish as soon as caught, and then hung
it on a branch of the moss-covered trunk.
Bessie had begun to look on the proceedings
with interest, feeling almost as
sorry as her companions as a ravenous
bull-head occasionally carried off the
hooks, when she heard a noise on the
road as of wheels. She ran to the
bushes which, divided it from the pond,
and putting her little face through, saw
that the miller who lived in the village
was passing with three or four large
sacks of meal in a wagon drawn by a
pair of horses. He was going the wrong
way, but the thought occurred to her
to stop him and ask how long it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
be before he should return, and if he
should do so by the same road. The
miller was a stout, good-natured looking
man, with an old hat and coat as white
as his meal bags. He seemed astonished
enough at seeing Bessie's head pop so
suddenly out of the bushes in that lonely
place.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie," said he, laughing, "if
I hadn't been as bold as a lion, perhaps
I might have mistaken you for a mermaid
that had just sprung out of the
pond to have a little private conversation
with me. Yes, I shall come back by
this road. I have got to deliver my
meal at the first house on the left, and
then I turn towards home again. Is
that your party that I catch a glimpse
of on the pond?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, "they're fishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
You wouldn't mind giving us a ride as
far as you go, Mr. Watson, would you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Watson laughed, and said no he
wouldn't, and telling her he should
return in fifteen minutes, he drove on.
Bessie hurried back to the children and
related her news. She was careful not
to be so selfish as to ask them to leave
the pond to go with her, but she told
them for their own benefit that the
miller was willing to take the whole
party. Enticing as the fishing was, the
two girls were now far too tired to
desire to walk home when they could
ride very nearly all the way. Martin
for his part would have liked to remain
longer, but he saw that it would be
ungenerous to refuse to accompany them,
even if it had been early enough to do
so, which it was not, for already the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was on the wane. So it was decided
to leave the pond.</p>

<p>Martin put Dolly's share of the fishes
on a separate twig, and very proud she
was of them. She said she should fry
them for her father's breakfast the next
morning, before he started for market.
The fishing poles were left lying near
the old tree.</p>

<p>When the miller drove up to the
place where Bessie had hailed him, he
found the children awaiting him. Dolly
and Martin, fish in hand, Nelly carrying
her bitter-sweet berries, and Bessie with
an empty basket, but a light heart at
the thought that now she should reach
home in good season to gather the
cresses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>LOST.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I can't</span> find it," said Bessie, about a
month after the fishing party. "I have
hunted high and low. I cannot find it
anywhere."</p>

<p>Her mother, whose health was now
greatly improving, was sitting in the
kitchen by the blazing fire, for the
weather was gradually growing colder,
and the logs were piled up a little
higher on the hearth, day by day. She
was busy finishing quilting a white counterpane
for a neighbor who employed
her frequently to sew for her family.
It was full of quaint devices, stars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
diamonds forming the border, while in
the centre was a wonderful little lamb
in the act of performing some very
frisky gambols.</p>

<p>"Cannot find what?" demanded Bessie's
mother.</p>

<p>"My Madeira nut!" exclaimed Bessie,
in a tone of despair. "Oh, what shall
I do? what shall I do?"</p>

<p>Her mother stopped quilting and
turned to look at her.</p>

<p>"Where did you put it last?" she
asked. "Surely, Bessie, you ought to
remember that."</p>

<p>"I have never put it in but one spot,"
replied Bessie; "I left it in the drawer
of my little table. When you grew
better, and the table wasn't needed any
more in your bedroom for you to stand
your medicines on, I got Nathan to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me take it up stairs in the garret, just
as you bade me, that day last week
when he was here spending the afternoon.
I thought I would still keep the
nut there, for I had grown used to the
place, and I liked to go to the drawer
and pull it out to look at it sometimes.
Oh dear, oh dear!" and Bessie burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you haven't searched well,"
said her mother; "come, I'll go up stairs
with you. I shouldn't wonder if it had
got caught in the top of the drawer.
I have heard of such things. I lost a
handkerchief that way myself once."</p>

<p>"But," sobbed Bessie, "it couldn't get
caught like that without being broken,
because it was so thin shelled, and then
I should have seen some of the pieces;
or the money would have fallen back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into the drawer, and I would have found
<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"How much was in it?" asked her
mother. "There could not have been
a great deal more than the very first
silver Mr. Dart brought you for the
cresses, for the rest we have spent from
time to time as fast as it was received.
I was sorry enough to do it too."</p>

<p>"I wasn't," said Bessie, brightening
up a little through her tears, "I was
glad and thankful, mother, to have it
to spend. If it had not been for the
cresses, what would have become of us
all the while you were so sick?"</p>

<p>"God always provides for the poor
and needy," said her mother gravely,
"and I am certain that He who knows
even when sparrows fall would not let
us suffer. If this help had not sprung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
up for us through Mr. Dart, something
else would have presented itself. Come,
now, let us go to the garret and look
for the money."</p>

<p>Bessie darted ahead of her mother
as they went up the stairs, with a bound
and a spring that brought her to the
head of the flight when her mother was
on the second step. She was young and
agile, and besides she was greatly excited
and in haste to begin the search. She
did not gain any thing by her speed,
however, for she had to wait at the
landing until her mother had toiled
slowly up.</p>

<p>"Now let us look at the drawer,"
said her mother, when, after pausing a
moment to breathe, she moved towards
the table. It was a poor little shaky
thing, and of a very dilapidated appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
It was not to be wondered at
that as soon as her recovery made its
presence unnecessary in her room, she
had banished it to the garret whence
it had been brought.</p>

<p>"You see there is no trace of it," said
Bessie, mournfully, as she watched her
mother remove the articles the drawer
contained one by one.</p>

<p>No, it was not there indeed.</p>

<p>Bessie pulled out the drawer, and even
took the trouble to examine the aperture
which contained it, but all was in
vain.</p>

<p>"It is certainly very strange," said
her mother. "I do not see how, if it
were really in this drawer, it could have
got out without help."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," added Bessie, half
laughing at the idea of a nut walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
off of itself. "Oh, if I could only find
it! I do not mind the nut so much,
although dear uncle James gave it to
me last Christmas, as I do the money,
for you know, mother, I asked you if
I might not keep it forever, that is as
long as I lived, to remember Mr. Dart's
kindness by, and to show, when I grew
up, as my first earnings. Oh, I was so
proud of those three pieces of silver!"</p>

<p>"What were they?" asked her mother,
looking over the contents of the drawer
again.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't you remember?</i>" exclaimed Bessie,
in a tone of great surprise, as though
it were really remarkable to have forgotten.
"Don't you remember? There
were two twenty-five cent pieces and a
ten cent piece!" and Bessie broke into
fresh weeping again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't cry about it, Bessie," said her
mother, "you know crying cannot bring
them back."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care," said the little girl,
"if it had been <i>yesterday's</i> money, but
it was the first, <i>the very first</i> I ever
earned of myself, and I meant to save
it always!"</p>

<p>"I think I can tell you exactly how
it happened, my child. Just look at
the untidy appearance of your drawer.
There are scraps in it of a great many
things that ought not to be there.
Here is a broken slate, your worn-out
work-basket, your summer sun-bonnet,
empty bottles, spools of cotton, and last
but not least, about a quart of hickory
nuts,&mdash;a nice array, I am sure."</p>

<p>Bessie hung her head. She was
ashamed to have her disorderly ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
remarked. A want of neatness was her
greatest fault.</p>

<p>"I was just going to clear it up to-morrow,"
she murmured, twitching rather
uneasily at her apron strings.</p>

<p>"Oh, my little girl, that 'just going'
of yours is one of the saddest things I
can hear you say. You are always '<i>just
going</i>,' and yet the time seldom comes
that you do as you intend. You are
full of good intentions that you are
either too lazy or too thoughtless ever
to fulfil. If I did not watch over you
very sharply, every thing you have
would be like this miserable looking
drawer, a complete mass of disorder."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" cried Bessie, quite
appalled at the news.</p>

<p>"Now," continued her mother, "I can
trace the losing of your money back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
your want of neatness. In all probability,
when you came to this drawer some
time to get a few of your hickory nuts,
you have caught up the Madeira among
the others, carried it down stairs, and
left the whole pile lying as you often
do, somewhere around the garden till
you feel in the humor for cracking
them. I want to know, in the first
place, why your hickory nuts were ever
put in this drawer among your books
and spools of cotton."</p>

<p>Bessie had been growing warmer and
warmer while her mother was speaking,
until it seemed to her as though the
tips of her ears were on fire. Conviction
forced itself upon her mind that
her Madeira nut must have gone in the
way her mother described, for she remembered
distinctly having often taken two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
or three handfuls of nuts and carried
them in her apron down to the garden,
leaving them lying carelessly about her
favorite resorts, under the old apple-tree
for instance, or on the big flat stone by
the brook. She had many just such
idle, unsystematic ways of managing.
She felt she was in the wrong, so she
scarcely knew how to defend herself.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I put the nuts
there, mother," she said, "unless it was
to get them out of the way. They are
those that are left of the basket full I
found in the woods by Mr. Dart's farm,
one day when Nelly and I went there
together."</p>

<p>"When <i>will</i> you learn neatness, Bessie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," sobbed Bessie, "never,
I 'spect. Seems to me I grow worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and worse. I don't believe I shall be
half as good when I am ten as I am
now when I'm only nine. I wish I had
never gone nutting, and then this would
not have happened."</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, smiling, "it
never would, for then in all probability
you would not have met and become
friendly with our good Mr. Dart. Don't
make rash wishes, my little Bess, because
you are vexed."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I know," cried Bessie, as
if struck with a sudden idea, "I put the
nuts in that drawer, mother, for <i>safety</i>.
Before that they were lying spread out
to dry on the floor, over by that barrel.
I remember thinking that they were
thinning out pretty fast, and that the
rats must have carried some away. I
thought that if I put them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
drawer they would last until I used
them up."</p>

<p>"Well," said her mother, "that betters
the case a little; but still I must insist
that you could have found many more
appropriate places. If you had put them
in the barrel it would have been far
better than among your spools, and I
do not know but that it would have
been quite as safe."</p>

<p>Bessie's mother went up to the barrel
in question, as she spoke, and scarcely
knowing what she was doing, shoved it
a little with her foot. It was empty,
and yielded easily. This change in its
position brought to view the space between
it and the wall, and there, what
did Bessie and her mother see but a
nice little pile of hickory nut-shells!</p>

<p>Bessie uttered an exclamation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sprang forward. She took up two or
three, and found that a hole had been
neatly nibbled in each and the meat
subtracted.</p>

<p>"I told you so," she said sorrowfully,
letting the shells drop slowly back to
the pile; "now I know why my nuts
disappeared so fast. I thought at first
that Nathan must have helped himself
to a few, when he has been here. He
often runs up stairs to get something
or other to play with, when he stays
the whole afternoon, and I guessed the
nuts had tempted him. Poor Nathan!
I ought to have known better."</p>

<p>Bessie's mother stooped and examined
every shell in the pile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said she, "master rat has
carried off the Madeira too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so," cried the little girl;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
"do you see any of the pieces of it,
mother? He could not harm the money
you know, and that is what I care most
about getting back."</p>

<p>"It is not here," said her mother,
rising, "but perhaps we shall hear
something of it yet. I want you to
put on your sun-bonnet and look carefully
about the garden. Take an hour,
or two hours if necessary, but do it
thoroughly. I must go down stairs now
to my sewing."</p>

<p>Bessie found it very tedious, sad work
searching for her lost treasure that afternoon.
She went to each of her favorite
haunts, and examined them with great
minuteness, but no trace of the nut was
to be discovered. One thing seemed to
her as very strange, however, and that
was, that of all the small supplies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
nuts which she had lately carried down
to the garden, and of which she did not
remember even to have cracked a single
one, not so much as a fragment of a
shell was now to be found. Only the
day before she had left a little strawberry
basket half filled, on the big stone
by the brook, to which the reader remembers
she once led Mr. Dart to survey
the cresses. She had meant to sit there
and crack and pick them out at once,
at her leisure, but something attracting
her attention as usual, she did not do
so, but deserted both basket and nuts.
The basket was there still, but to her
surprise, it was quite empty. It lay
on its side near where she had left it.
No mark of any one having been there
was to be seen in the muddy grass.</p>

<p>Bessie took up the basket and gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
at it in silent astonishment. What could
it mean? Who would help themselves
to her nuts in this way? and why was
the basket not carried off also? She
was still sitting on the stone thinking
the whole singular affair over, when she
heard Nathan call to her from the next
house, where he lived. She looked up,
and there he was leaning over the
fence. She had just been thinking of
him, and it made her feel unpleasantly
to see him.</p>

<p>"Bess," cried he, "what do you think?
father is going to give me a ride to
town to-morrow."</p>

<p>Bessie scarcely heard him as she rose,
and holding up her empty basket, said
reproachfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Nathan, how could you climb
over the fence and take my nuts?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nuts!" echoed Nathan, "what nuts?
I don't know any thing about your nuts."</p>

<p>"Somebody does," said Bessie, "for
this basket was half full yesterday, and
now it is empty. I left it here on the
stone all night."</p>

<p>"I never saw it," said Nathan; "that's
mighty pretty of you to accuse a fellow
of stealing. You had better be a little
careful."</p>

<p>"I didn't say you <i>stole</i>, Nathan, I
only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who cares for your old nuts?" interrupted
Nathan, "they're not worth the
carrying off. Next thing you'll be saying
I meddle with your cresses."</p>

<p>"No," said Bessie, a little sadly, "I
shouldn't say that. There are only two
or three baskets-full of nice ones left,
and by next week Mr. Dart will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
taken them all to market. I don't <i>care</i>
about my nuts, Nathan, it isn't that,
but I should like to know who took
them."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> didn't, anyhow," said Nathan,
"and since you are so cross about it, I
shan't stay to talk to you."</p>

<p>He clambered down from the fence
and walked away whistling, with his
hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>Some way, Bessie felt a presentiment
that Nathan knew more than he said
about the nuts. She concluded to go
in and ask her mother if it could possibly
be that he had taken the missing
money.</p>

<p>Her mother listened in silence to all
she had to utter on the subject. Bessie
told her that Nathan was aware, and
had been aware from the beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
where the Madeira nut was kept. She
said he was present when she first put
it in the drawer, which was indeed true,
as the reader knows, and that often
since, they had looked at it together.</p>

<p>"My dear," said her mother, when
Bessie concluded, "I do not see that
you have any thing more than <i>conjecture</i>
on which to found your suspicions. It
is very wrong to act on conjecture
only."</p>

<p>"But everybody thinks Nat is a bad
boy," said Bessie eagerly; "the neighbors
say he will do almost any thing.
Only last Sunday he pinned the minister's
coat tails to the shade of the church
window, as he stood talking to Deacon
Danbury, after meeting was over. When
the minister went to walk off, down
came the shade on his head and smashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his new hat. <i>I</i> think that a boy who
will do that would take things that do
not belong to him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he might," said her mother
quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, shall I ask him about it,"
demanded Bessie.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said her mother
gravely, "your ideas of justice are one-sided.
The world would not thrive if
every one acted on the principles you
seem to advocate. Many an honest man
might be imprisoned as a thief if people
should take mere <i>conjecture</i> for proof of
guilt, while at the same time, many a
thief would pass for an honest man. In
law, all persons are supposed innocent,
until they are <i>proved</i> guilty. You did
not <i>see</i> Nathan take any thing belonging
to you, nor do you know any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
did. It would be the height of cruelty
then, to accuse him without absolute
proof."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, "but suppose he
<i>did</i> take the nut after all."</p>

<p>"Then," said her mother, "we can
only leave the case to that Judge who
doeth all things well. It is better for
us to suppose him innocent even while
he may be guilty, than to suppose him
guilty when he is innocent."</p>

<p>"I wish I <i>knew</i>," said Bessie, as she
took up her shears and basket to go
out to get the cresses for the next day's
market.</p>

<p>"The cold weather will soon put a
stop to the cresses, I am afraid," remarked
her mother, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, "Mr. Dart says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
they are getting poor now; they do not
grow fast after cutting, any more, on
account of the frost."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said her mother cheerfully,
"in the spring, which after all is
not so <i>very</i> far off, they will become
fine again, and then you can begin to
sell as fast as ever. If I am well then,
as I hope and trust I shall be, we must
not touch a penny of your money, Bessie.
It shall all be saved to send you regularly
to Miss Milly's school, and buy
books for you to learn out of, and perhaps,
who knows, there will be something
left to put in the bank besides.
This fall the cresses have fed our poor,
suffering bodies, but next spring, if
nothing happens, they shall feed my
Bessie's mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"School!" cried Bessie, dropping both
the basket and the scissors in her delight,
"shall I <i>really</i> go to school? And all
through the water-cresses? Why, we
never thought our dear little brook
would make us so rich, did we, mother?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE NEST.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> clear and cold morning in winter,
as Bessie was passing along the road
that led by Nelly's home, she heard
Martin call her from the barn where
he was at work. He saw her passing
and beckoned to her to come to him.
Bessie had the singular habit which
most children possess of stopping to ask
why she was summoned, when at the
same time she fully intended to answer
the call in person. So she stood still,
and in a loud voice cried,</p>

<p>"Mar-<small>TIN</small>, what <i>is</i> it? What do you
want of me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come and see!" replied Martin, "I've
something nice to show you!" and then
he resumed his place at the hay-cutting
machine, at which he had been busy
when he espied her. He was mincing
the hay for the cattle to eat.</p>

<p>Bessie still stood irresolute. She meant
to come, but she desired her curiosity
to be gratified before she did so.</p>

<p>"Mar-<small>TIN</small>?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me <i>now</i> what it is?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Martin, going on with
his hay chopping; "I guess you will
have to come and see for yourself. It
almost splits my throat to be calling
out to you so."</p>

<p>"I think you might tell me," said
Bessie, opening the gate and walking
towards him; "you could have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it in half the time that you have been
talking about it. Mercy! have you cut
all that pile of hay this morning?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i131.jpg" width="331" height="467" alt="Sheep and children" />
<div class="caption">"A couple of white sheep came running eagerly up to Martin's outstretched
hand."&mdash;<a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a></div>
</div>

<p>"Yes," said Martin; "it's for the horses.
I sprinkle a little water on it, and they
like it a great deal better than when
it is dry and uncut. It's healthier for
them too."</p>

<p>"I am glad I don't live on it," said
Bessie. "I should be like the horse
that his master fed on shavings,&mdash;just
as I got used to it I should die."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Martin, laughing.
"Come, and I'll show you what I spoke
about." Bessie followed him as he led
the way across the yard to the part of
the barn where the large folding-doors
were situated. They were wide open,
and the clear winter sunshine streamed
on the floor. An old wagon and a ladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were placed across this opening, so
that no one could come in or go out
without climbing over.</p>

<p>"What is this for?" asked Bessie.
"This wagon don't belong here, Martin.
I never saw it here before."</p>

<p>"That's to keep the cows out," said
Martin, smiling. "We have treasures in
this part of the barn that it would not
do for the cattle to get at. Here Nanny,
here Jinny!"</p>

<p>A pattering of little hoofs was heard
on the wooden floor, and a couple of
white sheep came running eagerly up
to Martin's outstretched hand. They
rubbed themselves against it, and showed
in various other ways how glad they
were to see him.</p>

<p>"Aren't they pretty?" said Bessie
admiringly. "Come here, Nanny."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But Nanny would not touch Bessie's
hand, and backed up the barn, shaking
her head at the sight of it, and kicking
her delicate little heels in the air.</p>

<p>"They don't know you yet," said
Martin, "but they are very tame, and
would soon become acquainted if you
were with them every day as I am.
We have had them two weeks, and
already they let me play with them.
They are cossets."</p>

<p>"<i>Cossets</i>, Martin?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that means the pets of the
flock. The cosset lamb means the pet
lamb."</p>

<p>"Pet is a prettier word than cosset,"
said Bessie; "I should never call them
that. I do wish mother had two such
nice sheep. But why do you keep
them shut up here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"You haven't seen all yet," said Martin,
smiling; "just creep through this
place and round by these wheels, and
we will go in and find out why the
cows are kept out and the sheep kept
in."</p>

<p>Martin helped Bessie through the obstructions,
and led her to the back of
the barn where, nestled in a heap of
clean hay that was piled against the
opposite folding doors, she saw a little
bundle of something white, in which
she could just detect two small, glittering
eyes.</p>

<p>"It's a lamb," cried Bessie, skipping
about as if she were one herself.</p>

<p>"Two of 'em," said Martin. "Only
look here!" and he pulled apart the
loose whisps of hay, and there lay
revealed two of the fattest, whitest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
prettiest lambs that ever were seen.
They did not seem to like being admired,
but gave utterance to a little sharp cry
very much like a baby's. Hearing it,
one of the sheep trotted up, and pushing
between them and Martin, quietly began
to lick them.</p>

<p>"That's their mother," said Martin.
"They are twins, and only two days old.
The other old sheep is a twin of this
old one, and they are so fond of each
other that we cannot keep them separate.
At first we were afraid the aunty
would injure the young ones, and we
shut her out in the barn-yard, but she
came and stood at the door, there by
the wagon, and cried so piteously that
Mr. Brooks told me she might stay in
with her sister and her baby nieces. We
could not bear to hear her bleat so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't she bite or tread on them?"
asked Bessie.</p>

<p>"No," said Martin, "I think she is
very tender with them. This morning
one of the men threw a handful of hay
accidentally in a lamb's face, and when
it tried to push it off but couldn't, what
does old aunty do but walk up and eat
it away, every whisp. I thought that
was quite bright of her, and kind too.
On the whole I think they are a happy
family."</p>

<p>"Does Nelly like 'em?" asked Bessie,
as she patted the head of the one Martin
called the "aunty."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Martin, "she thinks they
are the handsomest animals on the place.
They grow fonder of her every day."</p>

<p>"I hope her father don't mean to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
them killed," remarked Bessie, a little
sadly.</p>

<p>"No indeed," cried Martin, "he bought
them for pets, and to look pretty running
about the meadow in the summer
time. He says they are too tame and
loving to be killed. I shouldn't like to
think of such a thing, I am sure. There,&mdash;do
see old Moolly poking her head
over the wagon! How she does want
to come in! She always was our pet
before, and I suppose it makes her a
little jealous. Poor Moolly,&mdash;good little
Moolly."</p>

<p>Martin picked up a corn-cob and
rubbed the cow's ears. She stood quite
still to let him do it, and when he
stopped she stretched out her head for
more and looked at him as if she had
not had half her share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are the little lambs named?" asked
Bessie, as she got up from the hay
to go.</p>

<p>"No," said Martin; "Nelly's father
told her she might call them any thing
she wanted, but she thinks they are
such funny little long-legged things that
she cannot find names pretty enough.
When they grow stronger they will frisk
about and be full of play."</p>

<p>"I mean to run over to the house to
see her and ask her about it," said Bessie.
"I am real glad you called me,
Martin, to look at them."</p>

<p>Martin went back to his hay-cutting,
and Bessie bade him good-by, and skipped
along the path to the house. Bessie
always skipped instead of walking or
running, when she was particularly
pleased with any thing. On knocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
at the farm-house door, she was told to
her great sorrow that Nelly was not
within, but when she heard that she
had just started to pay a visit to herself,
that sorrow was changed to joy, and
she turned to go home with a very
light heart and a pair of very brisk
feet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can overtake her," she
said to herself; but go as fast as she
could, she saw nothing of Nelly on the
road. When she reached home, she was
so warm with the exercise that it seemed
to her as though the day were a very
mild one indeed. As she pushed open
the door of the kitchen, her eyes were
so bright and her cheeks so red from
her little run, that her mother looked
up from her work and asked what she
had been doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only racing down the hill to find
Nelly," panted Bessie, sinking into a
chair as she spoke. "Isn't she here? I
didn't overtake her."</p>

<p>"No," replied her mother, "Nelly has
been here and gone. She was sorry
you were out."</p>

<p>"Gone!" echoed Bessie. "Well, if that
is not too bad! Mrs. Brooks said she
had just started. I am so sorry. Did
she tell you which way she was going?"</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, "she did not,
but she said perhaps she would stop on
her way back. Come, take off your
hat and shawl and hang them up, and
then begin hemming one of these towels.
I am in a great hurry to get them
done. They are Mrs. Raynor's, and I
promised to send them home to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessie loved to romp and play much
better than to sew, and these words of
her mother's did not consequently fill
her with satisfaction. She knew, however,
that by sewing their living was
to be gained, so she choked down the
fretful words that rose to her lips. She
felt that it was hard enough for her
mother to work, without having her
repinings to endure also. The glow and
cheerful effect of her walk, however,
faded away as she slowly untied her
hood, and hung it with her shawl on a
peg behind the door. She was deeply
disappointed at Nelly's absence.</p>

<p>"I wish she would have waited a
little while," she said; "I don't see her
so often now the winter has set in, that
I can afford to miss her. Mother, have
you seen my thimble?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" said her mother, "lost <i>again</i>,
Bessie? What shall I do with this careless
girl? There is my old one, you
can use that for a little while."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I remember," cried Bessie,
springing up, "I left it in the garret,
in the drawer of the old table, the last
time I was there. I'll get it, and be
down again in a moment."</p>

<p>She opened the door at the foot of
the stairs, and ran quickly up them.
She did not notice that she left the
door wide open, and that the cold air
rushed into the warm kitchen, nor did
she know that her mother, sighing, was
obliged to rise from her work and shut
it after her.</p>

<p>On went Bessie, and turning the landing,
began the second flight, two steps
at a time, as usual. She was very lightfooted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and owing to her disappointment
about Nelly, she did not feel quite gay
enough to hum the little tunes which
she generally did when going about the
house, so that altogether she scarcely
made any noise. Perhaps it was owing
to this that, as she reached the head
of the garret stairs, she saw something
run across the floor, evidently alarmed
at her unexpected appearance. She
stood still for a moment, hardly knowing
what it was, and not wishing to go any
further in the fear of frightening it
away before she could get a good look
at it. She decided at once, however,
from its size, that it was not a rat, for
it was far too large. It had taken refuge
behind some old furniture in a corner,
and in the hope that if she kept perfectly
still, it would venture out again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she sat down on the top step, and fixed
her eyes intently on the spot where she
had beheld it disappear. She had remained
thus but a short time when she
heard hasty footsteps coming from the
kitchen, and a voice that she recognized
as that of Nelly, called her name.
She did not answer, for she wanted to
unravel the mystery, whatever it might
be, and when Nelly, still calling, followed
her up to the stairs on which she sat,
she put her finger on her lip by way
of enjoining silence, and beckoned to
her to come to her. Nelly understood
in a moment, and slipping off her heavy
winter walking shoes, crept up and sat
down beside her.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Bessie, "don't
make a sound. There is some sort of
a little animal concealed behind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
old fire-board, and I want to see it come
out."</p>

<p>She spoke so low that Nelly had difficulty
in getting at the sense of what
she said, but when she did, she nodded
slightly, and the two little girls began
the watch together.</p>

<p>They sat there a long, long time.</p>

<p>Once or twice they thought they
heard a movement behind the fire-board,
but they saw nothing. At last, just as
they were becoming very weary of
remaining so long in the cold, Nelly
caught sight of a small pointed nose,
projecting from one side of the board.
As this nose moved slowly forward, a
pair of bright little eyes came into view
also, rolling restlessly about, as if seeking
to espy danger. It was with difficulty
the children could repress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
exclamations that were on their lips,
but with an effort they did so, and remained
just as quiet as before. Encouraged
by the dead stillness, the animal
advanced still further from its retreat,
peering all the while about it. Its body,
as near as they could see, was spotted
gray and white, and so were its pretty
ears, which were long, and in constant
motion. It ran cautiously from its place
of concealment, and at last, with a
graceful, hurried spring, landed on the
top of Bessie's table. Arrived there, it
sat down and looked about it again.
The children did not move. The drawer
of the table, as usual, was partially open,
according to Bessie's careless habit, and
the little creature put its mites of paws
carefully in the crack, bringing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
out again almost immediately with a
nut, at which at once it commenced to
nibble. It was an odd sight as it sat
there on its hind legs, holding the nut
in its front paws, and twisting and turning
it from side to side in order to find
a good place to plant its sharp teeth.
Nelly glanced at Bessie and longed to
burst into a laugh, but Bessie signified
to her by a movement of her eye-brows
and lips that she must not. It was
plain enough by this time that the little
thief was a squirrel. Bessie was quite
bewildered at the thought that it had
been able to get in the house without
her or her mother's knowledge. She
did not know that the race to which
the animal belonged is proverbial for
its cunning, and that often it steals a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
way into the habitations of men for no
other purpose than to find seeds and
grains on which to live.</p>

<p>Some accidental movement which Bessie
made, at length startled the squirrel
from its sense of security. It leaped
lightly from the table to the floor, and
disappeared behind some loose blocks
of wood, near the fire-board. As it did
so, Nelly saw that part of its tail was
missing, looking as if torn off at about
half its length.</p>

<p>"Bessie!" she exclaimed eagerly, as
her companion made a dart for the
blocks of wood, "Bessie, as sure as
you're alive, that's the same squirrel
we saw in the woods, the day we went
nutting."</p>

<p>"I know it," cried Bessie; "at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I am as sure as I can be, for that one
was like this, spotted white and gray,
and each of them had only a part of
a tail. To think of the little thing
being so hungry as to come after my
nuts! If I can only find its hole, I'll
feed it regularly every day."</p>

<p>"What <i>could</i> bring it so far from the
woods?" cried Nelly, laughing. "I never
heard of any thing more strange, even
in a book."</p>

<p>"You stay here and watch if it comes
out again," said Bessie, "and I'll run
tell mother. Perhaps she can help find
its hiding-place."</p>

<p>Nelly went with her as far as the
foot of the stairs to get her shoes, for
her feet were now growing very cold.
Then she returned to the garret, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
nothing more had been seen of the
squirrel when Bessie appeared with her
mother.</p>

<p>"It was here, just here, that it went
out of sight," cried Bessie; "somewhere
by these blocks and this old fire-board."</p>

<p>Her mother laughed, and said if there
were nothing worse than a squirrel in
the house, she should be glad.</p>

<p>"We must look," she added, "and
perhaps we can discover its nest; that
is, if it has one here, for, Bessie, it has
just occurred to me that this is the
way your Madeira nut disappeared. If
we can find the nest we may find your
money too," and she began to move out
the furniture from the wall.</p>

<p>At the mention of the Madeira nut,
Bessie colored deeply, and really seemed
struck with true shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, mother," she said, "to think that
I have never, all this while, cleaned out
that drawer! Some of the nuts are
still in it, and the other things too, just
as they were that day when I lost my
money. I have meant to clear it out
so many times!"</p>

<p>Her mother turned and looked at her
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Bessie," she said, "I have for years
done all I could do, to make a careful,
neat little girl, out of a careless, untidy
one. I am beginning now to leave you
to yourself, hoping that time will help
you to see yourself as others see you.
I have noticed often that your drawer
remained in the same condition, but I
did not speak of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," cried Bessie, frightened,
"don't leave me to myself, <i>don't</i>. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
never learn to be good at all, that way.
Oh, don't give me up yet."</p>

<p>"My poor child," said her mother, "if
you will only <i>try</i>, so that I can <i>see</i> you
trying, my confidence in you will come
back, but not otherwise. I want something
more than empty promises. You
forget them as soon as you make them."</p>

<p>"But I will try, I will <i>really</i> try <i>this</i>
time," said Bessie with tears in her
eyes. "I'm <i>lazy</i>, mother, I'm <i>real</i> lazy,
but I am not as bad as I might be.
I'll clean the drawer just as soon as we
look for the nest, <i>sure</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," said her mother, half smiling
at the little girl's doleful tone, "well, I
will give you this one more chance.
We will take the drawer for a new
starting point. Come, Nelly, let us
search now for the squirrel's hole. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
must be somewhere about here, for it
would never come up by the stairs, I
think."</p>

<p>They began a thorough hunt, lifting
up every light article in the out-garret,
where they were, and dragging the more
ponderous furniture from their places.
It was a sort of store-away place for
things not in every-day use, and therefore
it took some time to examine every
thing. An occasional pile of nibbled nut-shells
was all that was brought to light.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nelly, laughing, as she
looked under the last article, a little
broken chair belonging to Bessie. "Well,
I don't see but that Madame Squirrel
has escaped us. I can't meet with a
trace of her, for my part, beyond these
nut-shells."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," wofully added Bessie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet how could it have run away
from us, since we can find no hole in
the floor, and Nelly did not see it run
into any of these other rooms?" asked
Bessie's mother.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is hidden in the furniture
itself," remarked Nelly.</p>

<p>"Stop a moment," said Bessie's mother,
as Nelly began to pull out the drawers
of an old bureau, "here are some crossbeams
in the wall by the fire-board,
that look very much as though a set
of sharp teeth had nibbled a hole in
them,&mdash;yes, it is so! Well, I think
we've tracked the squirrel now! The
place is such a little way from the floor,
that it could jump in and scamper off
through the walls, before any one could
molest it. Perhaps it is far away in the
woods, laughing at us, at this minute."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The children drew near the beams in
question, with strong curiosity. It was
indeed as Bessie's mother said; there
were the marks of teeth in the wood,
and just where the beams joined was
a hole quite large enough for a squirrel
to pass through.</p>

<p>"It is the same one we saw in the
woods, I know it is," said Nelly, "but
what should bring it here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, in time, we can tame it;
that is if we have not already frightened
it away. <i>May</i> I try to tame it, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother. "I think Bunny
will make a pretty pet. We can
strew a few grains of corn, or a few
nuts about its hole every day, until it
learns to regard us as its friends; but
a little girl that I know must get into
the good habit of putting her things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
their proper places, and shutting her
table drawers <i>tight</i>, or it will continue
to help itself to more valuable things,
and make itself a plague to us. I do
not doubt that Bunny has your money
in its nest at this minute. It thought,
probably, that it was carrying off a
good, sound nut."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bessie, "and I dare say
it was it that ran off with those in my
basket, and all the others in the garden.
Poor, dear Nathan! I must tell him
about it, and ask him to forget my
cross words. One of my Sunday-school
hymns says, 'Kind words can never die.'
I wonder if the unkind words live forever
too. Do they, mother?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," was the answer, "but
many an unkind word leaves a sting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the mind of the person to whom it is
said, long after the one who uttered it
has entirely forgotten it. I don't believe
Nathan, for instance, will soon cease to
remember that you asked him why he
took your nuts. You acted too impulsively."</p>

<p>"Too <i>what</i>, mother?" asked Bessie,
curiously.</p>

<p>"Too <i>impulsively</i>. That is, you did not
wait to consider the matter, but spoke
out just as you felt, as soon as you saw
him. You must certainly ask him to
excuse you. If you are always very
gentle to him in future, perhaps your
offence will be forgotten. There is no
end to the soothing effect of those 'kind
words that never die!'"</p>

<p>"He was cross enough with <i>me</i> about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
it," said Bessie, reflectively. "I think
a few kind words would not hurt <i>him</i>
to say."</p>

<p>"We have nothing to do with Nathan
as to that," said her mother. "If he
chooses to be ill-tempered, it is his own
business, while it is ours to bear it from
him patiently. It is only by such means
that we can teach him how wrong he
is."</p>

<p>"I think that is pretty hard to do,"
said Bessie, shaking her head, "don't
you, Nelly? <i>I</i> always want to answer
right straight back."</p>

<p>"And if you do," said her mother,
"you will find that you invariably make
the case worse than before. A noble
poet, whose works you may read when
you are older, has said, 'Be silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
endure!' and experience will prove to
you both, that this silence and this
endurance is the true key to happiness.
Now, run down stairs, Bessie, and bring
me up the little saw. The idea has
just come to me, to saw away some
of the board at the side of these beams.
That will give us a good view of what
is going on in the wall, and will not
hurt its appearance much, either."</p>

<p>Bessie soon reappeared with the saw,
which, as it was small, her mother had
no difficulty in handling. She took it
from her and began operations at once,
inserting the sharp end of it in a crevice
in the wood, and moving it gradually
across the grain, until the end of the
board fell on the floor, where the sawdust
already lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, let me see!" cried Bessie, in
wild delight at this exposure of the
squirrel's haunt. And</p>

<p>"Oh, let <i>me</i> see <i>too!</i>" cried Nelly.</p>

<p>But Bessie's mother said she thought
she had better take a peep first, so she
lowered her eyes to the aperture and
looked in. It was dark, and her eyes,
accustomed to the sun-light, at first
could distinguish nothing. Gradually,
however, she found that she could see
a little way around the hole with great
distinctness, and it was not long before
a small heap of rags, apparently,
attracted her attention on one of the
corner beams.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother? what do you
find?" cried Bessie, as her mother put
in her hand to feel what this heap
could be. Something warm met the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
touch of her fingers, and she drew back,
slightly startled.</p>

<p>On examining further, she found that
this was indeed the animal's nest, and
that these soft, warm objects, curled up
in it so nicely, were probably her little
young ones.</p>

<p>"There!" she said, laughing, "come
see, children, what I have found! Here
is the squirrel's nest, and two of her
little babies!"</p>

<p>The girls peered eagerly through the
hole at these newly discovered treasures.</p>

<p>"The darlings!" cried Bessie, "we
can surely tame these little creatures,
mother, they are so young. It will be
no trouble at all."</p>

<p>"We must not take them from the
nest," replied her mother. "If we can
tame them by kindness, and by gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
accustoming them to our harmless
visits, I am very willing to make pets
of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, how pleasant that will be," exclaimed
Bessie, in an ecstasy. "Do look,
Nelly, at their pretty eyes. I don't
know but that I shall be just as well
satisfied with my two little squirrels as
you are with your two lambs."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she put in her hand to
touch the tiny animals on the head,
and smooth them softly, but something
at the side of the nest suddenly arrested
her attention, and she did not do so.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," she cried, "I do believe
here is my Madeira nut, among this
rubbish and empty hickory shells about
the nest. I do believe it,&mdash;I do believe
it! It <i>looks</i> like it, I am positive of
that. It seems whole, too. I don't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
it has been nibbled at all! How glad
I am!"</p>

<p>"Can you reach it?" asked her
mother; "if you can, do so."</p>

<p>Bessie made what she called "a long
arm," and in a moment more she seized
the nut and brought it into open daylight.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," she said, dancing around
the garret joyfully, "it <i>is</i> my nut! Here
is a little place in the side where the
squirrel has bitten, and you can see the
money right through it! She found that
there was nothing good to eat in it, so
she stopped just in time not to spoil it
entirely. I am so glad&mdash;I am so glad!"</p>
